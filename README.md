# HotspotBypass

An application to test your hotspot / network against MAC-Address changes.

### Important Note
I intended this software for TESTING, not actual attacks!

## How to Build
Clone into this repo. Then do
```
npm install
```
in your command prompt. You'll need Node and NPM installed.

After that you can run
```
npm run dev
```
for the application to launch.
